**Analysis and Forecasting of Maximum Ocean Wave Heights Using Time Series Models** 
Submitted to *Ocean Modelling* journal, April 2025.

This repository contains the source code, data, and results associated with the paper.

The study has two primary objectives:

1. **Analyze** the long-term evolution of maximum wave heights over the past eight decades in a specific coastal area chosen as a case study.
2. **Develop and compare** predictive models based on time series forecasting techniques to accurately estimate future maximum wave heights.

The Cantabrian coast, located in northern Spain, was selected as the focal region for this analysis.

## Repository Structure

- **Scripts/** 
  Contains the Python scripts and dataset used to produce models, graphics, and results. Scripts are numbered and can be executed sequentially.

- **Results/** 
  Contains graphics, plots, and CSV files generated from the scripts. Each subfolder is numbered and corresponds to the associated Python script(s).

- **Models/** 
  Contains the trained time series predictive models used to generate the results. Models are saved in different formats to avoid retraining. Arima and Sarima trained models are not included because their large size.
